  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>My professional experience has largely been in the realm of Test Engineering, Reliability Management, and Technical Writing in the electrical hardware and software industries. I started developing software and electrical circuits at a young age as a hobby. I am always pursuing an electrical hobby which is centered around web technology, neural networks (A.I.), robotics, and/or green energy. </p>

  <h3>JavaScript</h3>
  <p>I’ve used JavaScript for test automation at Xerox and Integra. At Xerox, I used Javascript to create a user interface for Chinese workers and automate a mechtronic test-bed that that would perform a functional test on circuit boards as they came off the assembly line. At Integra, I performed manual UI testing for their flagship product, DocuTrack, which is a document management application for pharmacies. We used the Agile Scrum methodology to manage our workload. I also maintained their library of automated tests, written in JavaScript. I wrote new test-cases as defects were discovered and features developed.</p>

  <p>I am constantly educating myself on JavaScript. Previous self-education includes the jQuery, Node, and Angular libraries and communication schemes like AJAX and JSON. I am teaching myself to develop Responsive websites like this one and to interface with different web databases. At present, I am going through the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank">Code School</a> courses on Angluar.js, Backbone.js, and SQL. I've also been giving myself exercises programming an embedded web server (A <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12994" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>) with software written in Node.js.

  <h3>Embedded Software</h3>
  <p>For about a decade I was obsessed with robotics and was sure that this was the career path for me. I’ve since gravitated toward software and web technology, but still use a lot of the skills I developed in embedded software. The majority of the software I wrote was in C++, but I am also competent in BASIC and assembly when needed. I do a lot of simulation in Matlab.</p>

  <h3>Electrical Engineering</h3>
  <p>The majority of my career has been spent in the field of electrical engineering. For three years I worked at the PACCAR Technical Center, which owns the Kenworth and Peterbilt line of semi-trucks. I was put in charge of validating their battery, alternator, starter, and exterior lighting systems. I designed and built test fixtures that would perform HALT tests in order to assess a components reliability for warranty.</p>

  <p>Prior to working at PACCAR, I worked at Xerox and designed similar, but smaller and more advanced test harnesess for the functional testing of circuit boards as they came off the assembly line. At each company, the test fixtures used a combination of motors, sensors, microcontrollers, and high level PC control. At PACCAR I took several courses on Six Sigma and Reliability Management. I exercised my knack for statistical analysis.
