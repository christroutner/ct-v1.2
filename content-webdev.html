    This section gives examples of the web design and SEO projects I've worked on over the last few years. 
    Rather than present every project I've ever worked on, the collapsable tabs below contain only a few hand-picked examples of my previous work.

            These are examples of websites that I've designed for clients and friends. 
            Each website had unique requirements and goals for their website owners.

              <a href="http://christroutner.com/brian/v0.0.01/" target="_blank">Cascade Mountain Metal Art</a> - This is a website I created for my brother. 
              He creates metal art using a CNC plasma cutter and welding equipment.
              The purpose of the site was to display his artwork, so it was intended to be picture heavy and visually appealing.
              The site is designed with the Bootstrap framework. 
              Rather than starting from scratch, I started with <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/55398.html" target="_blank">this template</a>. 
              I combined animation features that I liked in the template in order to customize the template for this sites needs.
              Creation of the entire site took less than eight hours.

              <a href="http://wellfuture.com" target="_blank">WellFuture.com</a> - This was an establish <a href="http://shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a> e-commerce site that I was hired to optimize and make mobile-friendly.
              The owner loved her current theme and didn't want it to change, but the original designer was unavailable.
              I imported the open source <a href="https://github.com/luciddesign/bootstrapify" target="_blank">Boostrapify Theme</a> into Shopify and mimicked the layout of the original site, 
              carefully using Bootstrap elements to make the site Responsive.

              <a href="https://powersystemsplusinc.com/" target="_blank">Power Systems Plus</a> - This was a complete redesign of the website for a small business.
              Wordpress was used as the CMS platform because the busienss owners wanted to manage the site after it was designed, and Wordpress was the easiest for them to learn.
              I created the site using a Responsive theme that the site owners liked.
              I integrated the <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce plugin</a> in order to give the site shopping cart functionality.

            The examples below explore fairly advanced concepts of SEO. 
            These are quantitative analysises on ranking in Google that go beyond simple checklists of using title and header tags effectively.

              <a href="http://www.doctor650.com/" target="_blank">Doctor650.com</a> Case Study - I joined <a href="http://thekeywordacademy.com/" target="_blank">The Keyword Academy</a> (TKA) in 2010 and was mentored by Court Tuttle.
              Doctor650 is a case study that Court completed, post Panda and Penguin updates, to show us that it was still possible to rank websites for
              competitive keywords with properly designed back-links. He ranked a brand new site (<a href="http://www.doctor650.com/" target="_blank">doctor650.com</a>) for the keyword '650 credit score', a very competitive keyword. 
              Within less than a month and only 14 back-links, he was able to <a href="files/650%20credit%20score%20-%20Google%20Search.pdf" target="_blank">rank the page in the second position for this keyword</a>. 
              After presenting a webinar on his case study, I went through
              the back links and created <a href="files/Link_Agression.xlsx">this spreadsheet</a> detailing the back-link profile and agressivness with anchor text.
              I also created <a href="files/Doctor650.com_650_Credit_Score.jpeg" target="_blank">this visual map of the link structure between webpages</a>.
              This case study is the basis on which I create all SEO and content-strategy advertising for my clients.

              <a href="files/SJS-case-study.html" target="_blank">SanJuanSufficiency.com Case Study</a> - This is a case study I created for TKA, as part of it's 'mastermind' group.
              This was created after the Doctor650 case study and it was an attempt to apply Court's linking method to two pages on my personal blog.
              This was a much smaller version of Court's case study applied to single pages <i>within</i> a site as opposed to a whole site used in the Doctor650 case study.
              The results were impressive. Following the same tiered linking structure as Court, I was able to get the two pages in my case study on the first page of Google for their target keywords with just a handful of links and content.

              Keyword Analysis - The first step in assessing a site for SEO improvement is to perform a keyword analysis.
              <a href="files/keyword-analysis-081315.xlsx">Here is an example keyword analysis</a> done on my site <a href="http://sanjuansufficiency.com" target="_blank">San Juan Sufficiency</a>.
              The analysis is performed by following the instructions on <a href="http://searchengineland.com/replacing-googles-not-provided-seo-gold-220045" target="_blank">this web site</a>.
              The scope of the analysis is to assess what keywords a site is ranking for and to review the traffic statics on a per-keyword basis.
              After the keyword analysis, a navigation analysis is done. For example, in the case of <a href="http://wellfuture.com" target="_blank">WellFuture</a>, the site was made mobile-friendly and
              the number of clicks required to make a purchase was reduced.
              The results of the keyword analysis is then used to craft an effective AdWords and Content/SEO marketing campaign.
