  </APPLET> This page is the finished applet for Project 4 (of 4) in my Java 
course. It's simply an x-y grid from 0 to 100 in each direction.</p>
<p>Enter point with x and y coordinates in the range from 0 to 100 and the point 
will be plotted. A line will connect all the dots.</p>
<p>Click on a plotted point to remove it form the grid. The line automatically 
refreshes </p>
<p>The purpose of this program was to get more practice with the creation and 
design of a GUI and to introduce new ways of working with JPanel, JButton, 
JTextField, and JLabel.<br>
