  </APPLET>This page is the finished applet for Project 3 (of 4) in my Java 
course. It is a game for little children to help them learn their colors and 
shapes.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><u>First Round:</u></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">A 'beep' is sounded when the mouse 
moves over each shape until the mouse is moved over the yellow circle. The 
program then proceeds to the second round.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><u>Second Round:</u></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">A 'beep' is sounded when the mouse 
moves over each shape until it moves over the red square. The program then 
proceeds to the third level.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><u>Third Round:</u></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">This round does not end. Each circle 
is randomly moved to a new location within the panel when the mouse moves over 
it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this program was to familiarize myself with the creation and 
design of a GUI as well as introduction to containers, randomization, and user I/O.</p>
